FoundYou — Runtime ID Validator
=================================
Detects and reports ID assignment problems while the system is running.

Problems detected
-----------------
  SWAP      Two active tracks on different cameras are probably the same
            person — their gallery embeddings are very close but they have
            different global IDs.  Root cause: flipped camera, low probe
            count at match time, or threshold too loose.

  DUPLICATE One camera has two active tracks that are too similar to each
            other — likely ByteTrack split one person into two local tracks
            and the ReID manager didn't merge them yet.

  UNSTABLE  A track's intra-gallery cosine variance is high — its stored
            embeddings are inconsistent, meaning it may have accumulated
            frames from more than one person.

Usage
-----
  Instantiate once and call check() on every MERGE_INTERVAL tick:

    validator = IDValidator(mgr)
    # in main loop, periodically:
    issues = validator.check(ts)
    for issue in issues:
        log.warning(issue.summary())

  Or wire it into the UI — ui.py calls draw_validation_overlay() to
  render issues directly onto the sidebar.
